# 📦 Variables in Shell Script

## 🔹 What is a Variable?

- A variable is used to store data and reuse it later.

## 🔹 Rules for Variables

### 1. No space around '='
 ```bash
 name=seema
 ```

### 2. Variable names are case-sensitive

### 3. Use $ to access variable value

## 🔹 Example (4.sh)
```
#!/bin/bash

name="Seema"
age=25

echo "My name is $name and age is $age"
```

### Run the script:

```
bash 4.sh
```
