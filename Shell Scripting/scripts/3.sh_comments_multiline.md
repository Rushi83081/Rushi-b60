* **Multi-line comments** can be written using Here Document syntax.

* ### Steps :- 
    - vim 3.sh
    - In vim editor
      
## 🔹 Example (3.sh)

the shell
will not
execute this
line
comment

echo "Checking multi line comment"
```

### Run the script:

```
bash 3.sh
```

### 📌 Note:
- Comments are ignored by the shell and are used to explain the script for better understanding.
- The starting word and ending word must be the same, and any text written between them is ignored by the shell.
- Instead of the word comment, any valid word can be used as the delimiter.
    - << END -> //comment -> END
    - << NOTE -> //comment -> NOTE
    - << ABC -> //comment -> ABC
