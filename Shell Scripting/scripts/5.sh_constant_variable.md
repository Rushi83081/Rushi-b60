## 🔒 Constant Variables

A **constant variable** is a variable whose value cannot be changed once set.

## 🔹 Use readonly keyword


```
readonly college="Metro"
echo "My college name is $college"

college="ABC"   # This will not change the value
```

### 📌 Attempting to modify a readonly variable will result in an error.
