# 🌟 Short Version (40–60 Seconds)

Hello, my name is Rushikesh Gaikwad. I completed my BCA from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sangli, and I am currently pursuing a DevOps course at CloudBlitz, Pune. During my training, I worked on multiple hands-on projects such as 3-Tier Architecture, Netflix Clone, Myntra Clone, Amazon Clone, Super Mario Deployment, and an Angular Application on Kubernetes.

🖥️ Linux Skills

I learned file and directory management, the Vim editor, user and permission management, process monitoring, networking commands, and package installation.

☁️ AWS Skills

I worked with major AWS services including EC2, VPC, EBS/EFS, S3, CloudWatch, Route 53, CloudFront, Lambda, RDS, and IAM.

⚙️ DevOps Skills

I practiced Git for version control, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, and Jenkins for CI/CD automation.
I also used monitoring tools like Datadog and Grafana for performance visualization.

# 🌟 Medium Version 

Hello, my name is Rushikesh Gaikwad, and I have completed my **BCA** from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sangli. I am currently pursuing a **DevOps** course at CloudBlitz, Pune, where I worked on projects such as **3-Tier Architecture Deployment**, **Netflix Clone**, **Myntra Clone**, **Amazon Clone**, **Super Mario Deployment**, and deploying an **Angular application on Kubernetes**.

In ***Linux***, I learned how to manage **files and directories**, work efficiently with the **Vim editor**, handle user and group management, and manage **file permissions with ownership** and ACLs. I also practiced **process management** for monitoring and troubleshooting services, used important **networking commands** to diagnose connectivity issues, and worked with **package management** tools like apt and yum for installing and updating software. 

In ***AWS***, I learned how to launch and manage servers using **EC2**, create secure networks using **VPC**, and work with storage services like **EBS, EFS**, and **S3**. I used **CloudWatch** to monitor logs and system performance, and **Route53** for DNS management. I also worked with **CloudFront** to speed up content delivery globally, used **Lambda** to run functions without servers, managed databases using **RDS**, and configured secure access and policies through **IAM**.

In ***DevOps***, I worked with **Git** for version control and code collaboration, and used **Docker** to create and run applications in containers. I deployed and managed these containers using **Kubernetes**, which helped me understand how applications are scaled, managed, and kept running smoothly. I also automated cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** and built CI/CD pipelines in **Jenkins** to automate the build and deployment process. For monitoring and observability, I used **Datadog** and **Grafana** to track application performance, logs, and system health.
