Good morning and thank you for the opportunity
My name is **Rushikesh Gaikwad** and I have completed my **BCA** from **Bharati Vidyapeeth Sangli**

Currently I am working as a **DevOps Intern at Hisan Labs Pvt Ltd** for the last six months and before that I pursued a DevOps course at **CloudBlitz Pune**.

I work regularly with Linux based systems where I handle file and directory management user and permission control process monitoring log analysis and basic shell scripting for automation and troubleshooting

From a cloud perspective I have hands on experience working with AWS services including compute networking storage and database components focusing on secure scalable and highly available infrastructure

For automation and delivery workflows I use version control and CI CD practices to automate build test and deployment processes and ensure smooth application releases

I work with containerization to build and manage application images and deploy them consistently across multiple environments

I manage containerized applications using orchestration platforms where I handle deployments rolling updates autoscaling health checks and basic cluster troubleshooting

I follow safe release practices such as rolling and blue green deployments to reduce downtime and support quick rollback when required

For monitoring and observability I track system health application performance logs and alerts to support proactive issue detection and faster resolution

I have worked on multiple hands on projects including 3 Tier Architecture deployment Kubernetes based application deployments production style clone projects and frontend application deployments

Overall my experience includes cloud infrastructure automation continuous delivery containerized deployments monitoring and operational best practices and I am eager to contribute to reliable secure and scalable DevOps environments

Thank you

# 🌟 Medium Version (Best)

Hello, my name is Rushikesh Gaikwad, and I have completed my **BCA** from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sangli. I am currently pursuing a **DevOps** course at CloudBlitz, Pune, where I worked on projects such as **3-Tier Architecture Deployment**, **Netflix Clone**, **Myntra Clone**, **Amazon Clone**, **Super Mario Deployment**, and deploying an **Angular application on Kubernetes**.

In ***Linux***, I learned how to manage **files and directories**, work efficiently with the **Vim editor**, handle **user and group management**, and manage **file permissions with ownership** and **ACLs**. I also practiced **process management** for monitoring and troubleshooting services, used important **networking commands** to diagnose connectivity issues, and worked with **package management** tools like apt and yum for installing and updating software. 

In ***AWS***, I learned how to launch and manage servers using **EC2**, create secure networks using **VPC**, and work with storage services like **EBS, EFS**, and **S3**. I used **CloudWatch** to monitor logs and system performance, and **Route53** for DNS management and managed databases using **RDS**. I also worked with **CloudFront** to speed up content delivery globally, used **Lambda** to run functions without servers, and configured secure access and policies through **IAM**.

In ***DevOps***, I worked with **Git** for version control and code collaboration, and used **Docker** to create and run applications in containers. I deployed and managed containers using **Kubernetes**, which helped me to understand how applications are scaled, managed, and kept running smoothly. I also automated cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** and built CI/CD pipelines in **Jenkins** to automate the build and deployment process. For monitoring, I used **Datadog** and **Grafana** to track application performance, logs, and system health.
