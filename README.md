Good morning and thank you for the **opportunity**  
My name is **Rushikesh Gaikwad** and I have completed my **BCA** from **Bharati Vidyapeeth IMRDA Sangli**

Currently I am working as a **DevOps Intern** at **Hisan Labs Pvt Ltd** and before that I pursued a **three month DevOps course** at **CloudBlitz Pune**

I work regularly with **Linux based systems** where I handle **file and directory management**, **user management**, **group management**, **permissions**, **process monitoring**, **log analysis**, and **shell scripting** for **automation** and **troubleshooting**

From a cloud perspective I have **hands on experience** with **AWS** including **EC2**, **VPC**, **IAM**, **S3**, **EBS**, **EFS**, **RDS**, **Route53**, **CloudFront**, and **EKS**, focusing on **secure**, **scalable**, and **highly available infrastructure**

For **automation** and **delivery workflows** I follow **version control** and **CI CD practices** using **Git** and **Jenkins** to automate **build**, **test**, and **deployment pipelines** and ensure **reliable application releases**

I work with **containerization** using **Docker** to **build**, **tag**, and **manage container images** and deploy them consistently across **multiple environments**

I manage **containerized applications** using **Kubernetes** where I handle **deployments**, **rolling updates**, **autoscaling**, **health checks**, and **cluster troubleshooting**

I follow **deployment strategies** such as **rolling deployments** and **blue green deployments** to achieve **zero or minimal downtime** and support **quick rollback** when required  

For **monitoring and observability** I track **system health**, **application performance**, **logs**, and **alerts** using **Grafana** and **Datadog** for **proactive issue detection** and **faster incident resolution**

I have worked on **hands on projects** including **3 Tier Architecture deployment**, **Kubernetes based application deployments**, **Netflix**, **Amazon**, and **Myntra clone projects**, **Super Mario deployment**, and **Angular application deployment on Kubernetes**

Overall my experience includes **cloud infrastructure automation**, **continuous integration**, **continuous delivery**, **container orchestration**, **monitoring**, and **DevOps best practices**, and I am eager to contribute to **reliable**, **secure**, and **scalable DevOps environments**

Thank you

# 🌟 Medium Version (Best)

Hello, my name is Rushikesh Gaikwad, and I have completed my **BCA** from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sangli. I am currently pursuing a **DevOps** course at CloudBlitz, Pune, where I worked on projects such as **3-Tier Architecture Deployment**, **Netflix Clone**, **Myntra Clone**, **Amazon Clone**, **Super Mario Deployment**, and deploying an **Angular application on Kubernetes**.

In ***Linux***, I learned how to manage **files and directories**, work efficiently with the **Vim editor**, handle **user and group management**, and manage **file permissions with ownership** and **ACLs**. I also practiced **process management** for monitoring and troubleshooting services, used important **networking commands** to diagnose connectivity issues, and worked with **package management** tools like apt and yum for installing and updating software. 

In ***AWS***, I learned how to launch and manage servers using **EC2**, create secure networks using **VPC**, and work with storage services like **EBS, EFS**, and **S3**. I used **CloudWatch** to monitor logs and system performance, and **Route53** for DNS management and managed databases using **RDS**. I also worked with **CloudFront** to speed up content delivery globally, used **Lambda** to run functions without servers, and configured secure access and policies through **IAM**.

In ***DevOps***, I worked with **Git** for version control and code collaboration, and used **Docker** to create and run applications in containers. I deployed and managed containers using **Kubernetes**, which helped me to understand how applications are scaled, managed, and kept running smoothly. I also automated cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** and built CI/CD pipelines in **Jenkins** to automate the build and deployment process. For monitoring, I used **Datadog** and **Grafana** to track application performance, logs, and system health.
