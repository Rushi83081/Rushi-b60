# Bank Management System – DevOps Project (Explanation)

During my six-month internship, I worked on a Bank Management System project. The system was designed for internal and academic use and handled banking operations such as customer account management, user access control, and simple transaction processing. The project was done by a team of 10 members: 2 frontend developers, 4 backend developers, 2 database engineers, and 2 DevOps engineers.

The application was developed using a microservices architecture, where each service works independently and can be deployed separately. The backend services were developed using Java and Spring Boot, the frontend was built using React, and MySQL was used as the database. This architecture helped improve scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

In this project, I worked as a DevOps Engineer. My responsibilities included automating the build and deployment process, managing infrastructure, and ensuring smooth delivery of the application across different environments. I mainly focused on DevOps tasks rather than application development.

I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. Whenever developers pushed code to GitHub, the pipeline automatically triggered the build process, performed basic checks, created Docker images, and deployed the application to a Kubernetes cluster. This automation reduced manual effort and improved deployment speed.

Docker was used to containerize the application so that it runs consistently across development and testing environments. These containers were deployed and managed using Kubernetes, which helped with container orchestration, load balancing, scaling, and application availability.

I also worked on basic monitoring to track application health and system resource usage such as CPU and memory. This helped in identifying issues early and maintaining application stability. Overall, this internship project provided me with hands-on experience in DevOps tools and helped me understand how automation improves reliability and efficiency in real-world applications.

# Medical Management System – Project (Explanation)

During my internship, I worked on a Medical Management System project. This system was used to manage patient information, doctor access, appointments, and basic medical records. The project was completed by a team of 10 members, including frontend, backend, database, and DevOps engineers.

The application was built using separate modules so that each part works independently. The frontend was developed using React, the backend was built with Spring Boot, and MySQL was used to store the data. This made the system easier to manage and update.

I worked as a DevOps Engineer in this project. My main role was to support the development team by automating deployment and managing application environments.

I created a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. When developers pushed code to GitHub, the pipeline automatically built the application, created Docker images, and deployed them to the server. This helped reduce manual work and made deployments faster.

Docker was used to package the application so it works the same on all systems. Kubernetes was used to manage and run these containers, which helped with scaling and availability.

I also monitored the application to check system health and resource usage. This internship project helped me understand how DevOps tools are used in real projects and improved my practical skills.

# DevOps Internship Project & Professional Overview

## Introduction + Explanation 

Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity.

My name is Rushikesh Gaikwad, and I have completed my **BCA** from **Bharati Vidyapeeth IMRDA, Sangli**. Currently, I am working as a DevOps Engineer Intern at Hisan Labs Pvt Ltd, Pune. Before starting my internship, I completed a four-month DevOps course at CloudBlitz, Pune. 

I regularly work with Linux-based systems, where I handle tasks such as file and directory management, user and group management, permissions, process monitoring, log analysis, and basic shell scripting for automation and troubleshooting. 

From a cloud perspective, I have hands-on experience with AWS services including EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, EBS, EFS, RDS, Route 53, CloudFront, and EKS. My focus is on building secure, scalable, and highly available cloud infrastructure that supports application performance and reliability.

In ***DevOps***, I worked with **Git** for version control and code collaboration, and used **Docker** to create and run applications in containers. I deployed and managed containers using **Kubernetes**, which helped me to understand how applications are scaled, managed, and kept running smoothly. I also automated cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** and built CI/CD pipelines in **Jenkins** to automate the build and deployment process. For monitoring, I used **Datadog** and **Grafana** to track application performance, logs, and system health.
