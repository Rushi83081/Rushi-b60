# 🌟 Short Version (40–60 Seconds)

Hello, my name is **Rushikesh Gaikwad**. I have completed my **BCA** from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sangli, and I am currently pursuing a DevOps course at CloudBlitz, Pune. During my training, I worked on hands-on projects such as **3-tier architecture, Netflix clone, Amazon clone, Myntra clone, and Super Mario deployment**.

In Linux, I worked on **file and directory management**, **user and group management**, **permissions**, **Vim editor**, and **package management** for installing and updating services.

In AWS, I used **EC2** to launch servers, **VPC** to create isolated networks, **EBS, EFS, and S3** for storage, **RDS** for database management, **Route 53** for DNS services, and **CloudWatch** for monitoring.

In DevOps, I worked with **Git** for version control, **Docker** for containerization, **Kubernetes** for container orchestration, **Terraform** for infrastructure automation, **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline automation, and **Datadog and Grafana** for monitoring. Thank you.

# 🌟 Medium Version (Best)

Hello, my name is Rushikesh Gaikwad, and I have completed my **BCA** from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sangli. I am currently pursuing a **DevOps** course at CloudBlitz, Pune, where I worked on projects such as **3-Tier Architecture Deployment**, **Netflix Clone**, **Myntra Clone**, **Amazon Clone**, **Super Mario Deployment**, and deploying an **Angular application on Kubernetes**.

In ***Linux***, I learned how to manage **files and directories**, work efficiently with the **Vim editor**, handle **user and group management**, and manage **file permissions with ownership** and **ACLs**. I also practiced **process management** for monitoring and troubleshooting services, used important **networking commands** to diagnose connectivity issues, and worked with **package management** tools like apt and yum for installing and updating software. 

In ***AWS***, I learned how to launch and manage servers using **EC2**, create secure networks using **VPC**, and work with storage services like **EBS, EFS**, and **S3**. I used **CloudWatch** to monitor logs and system performance, and **Route53** for DNS management and managed databases using **RDS**. I also worked with **CloudFront** to speed up content delivery globally, used **Lambda** to run functions without servers, and configured secure access and policies through **IAM**.

In ***DevOps***, I worked with **Git** for version control and code collaboration, and used **Docker** to create and run applications in containers. I deployed and managed containers using **Kubernetes**, which helped me to understand how applications are scaled, managed, and kept running smoothly. I also automated cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** and built CI/CD pipelines in **Jenkins** to automate the build and deployment process. For monitoring, I used **Datadog** and **Grafana** to track application performance, logs, and system health.
