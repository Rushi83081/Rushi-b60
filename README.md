(Use this when time is less)

Good morning/afternoon sir/ma’am. My name is Rushikesh Gaikwad. I completed my BCA from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sangli, and I am currently pursuing a DevOps course at CloudBlitz, Pune. During the training, I worked on projects like 3-Tier Architecture, Netflix Clone, Myntra Clone, Amazon Clone, Super Mario Deployment, and Angular App on Kubernetes.

In Linux, I learned file and directory management, Vim editor, user and permission management, process monitoring, networking commands, and package installation.
In AWS, I worked with EC2, VPC, EBS/EFS, S3, CloudWatch, Route53, CloudFront, Lambda, RDS, and IAM.
In DevOps, I practiced Git for version control, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Terraform for IaC, Jenkins for CI/CD, and tools like Datadog and Grafana for monitoring.
